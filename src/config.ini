# MultiOgar-Edited configurations file.
# [NOTES]
# Lines starting with hashtags are comments, not configs.
# MultiOgar uses size configuration instead of mass for performance purposes (so does Agar.io).
# The equation for size to mass calculation is: SIZE * SIZE / 100 = MASS.
# You can use the 'mts(mass)' syntax instead of doing the above calculation to find the correct size value.

# [LOGGING]
# logVerbosity: Console log level (0=NONE, 1=FATAL, 2=ERROR, 3=WARN, 4=INFO, 5=DEBUG).

# serverViewBase: Base view distance of players. Warning: high values may cause lag! (default: 1960x1160).
